Description:

This program is designed to find
the estimate of pi by using
four different types of implementations
for apporximating definite integerals.
The program uses the trapizoid rule,
simpsons 1/3 rule, simpsons 3/8 rule, and
booles rule. Once the program is started
values will start to be given to each
of the definite integral approximations.
After the calculations have been complete
a table of the errors compared to the real
value of pi are printed to standard out.

How to compile:

To build all programs in the archive the user should type
"make" in the command line. Typing "make" will run a script
which will compile all files in the archive. If the user
wioshes to run the pi.c program tey chould type ./pi into the
command lkine after building the program with "make". If the
user wishes to test all files in the archive they should type
"prove" into the command line.
